There are a range of possible errors that may encounter with Lab4 and Visual Studio 2012 (or higher), so I will try to clarify how they are solved in this announcement.\r\nVS2012 introduced a new local database mechanism called SQL Server Local/DB which replaces the previous SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, there is not any backwards compatibility, so the original database I provided might not work If you see an error message about SQL Server Express or something like that, then that means you are using the wrong database file.\r\nAnother error is possible with the new Local/DB file.\r\nSeveral students (including myself) discovered that no matter what they did, they started seeing a error message about not being about to connect to the database: \"A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 50 - Local Database Runtime error occurred. Error occurred during LocalDB instance startup: SQL Server process failed to start\"\r\n The solution to this problem is as follows:\r\n1. Open a cmd window\r\n2. type in the following commands:\r\nsqllocaldb delete \"v11.0\"\r\nsqllocaldb create \"v11.0\"\r\n \r\nFinally, VS2012 has changed the interface for the New Query. In lab4, there are instructions (for instance on page 13) to the Add Table Dialog and other things that are no longer available in VS2012.  In previous versions of VS, there was a Microsoft Access style visual query builder but now it seems VS2012 only provides a command window for typing in SQL commands.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

I have uploaded the draft manuscript of the first JavaScript chapter for the second edition of the textbook.\r\nYou may remember that Ricardo and I are beginning to work on the second edition of our textbook. In the new edition, the JavaScript coverage is going to be substantially expanded. Instead of two chapters on JavaScript, it will have four chapters: ch 8 - Language Fundamentals, ch 9 - using javascript [DOM and events], ch 10 Extending JavaScript [jquery + ajax], and ch 20 Frameworks [angular + node.js].\r\nI have completed and uploaded to Blackboard the manuscript for the language fundamentals chapter. It is a pdf of the Microsoft Word draft, so it doesn't have all the fancy formatting etc that the finished version will have. You are welcome to take a read through it if you are interested. Eventually in the fall, copy editors and proof readers will give it a closer read and fix up grammar problems and so on. What I would be interested in hearing now from any of you are \"bigger\" issues (e.g., \"this explanation didn't make sense\" or \"this could use a better example\" or \"you should also talk about X here\" etc). \r\nOf course, you are busy with a lot of courses right now so there is absolutely no expectation on any of you. However, if you do find yourself reading through parts of it over the next several months, and you do find yourself having opinions, I would be happy to hear them.

I would love if you would be willing to fill out an online survey about your knowledge of the different computing disciplines. This is part of an on-going international research project for which I am one of main investigators. The survey takes about 10 minutes and is 100% optional and 100% anonymous. It asks a few demographic questions and then gives you a series of computing tasks (e.g., \"Designs testing procedures for large scale systems\"), and then asks you to rank on a scale of 1-5 whether you think it belongs to Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, or Software Engineering. There are no right or wrong answers; we are interested in what computing tasks majors and non-majors think \"belong\" to different disciplines. Some respondents are familiar with these disciplines, while others are not knowledgeable. This survey helps us better understand what undergraduates know about these different computing disciplines in general. This research will help inform the construction of guidance counseling material (which is the last phase of this research). At any rate, me and my research team would be thrilled if you could spend 10 minutes to fill out the survey.\r\nThe URL for the survey is:\r\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/ r/computing-disciplines \r\nRegards,\r\nRandy\r\n\r\n",

For this reason, we will likely be using different approaches to set up and hand in our labs. For our first lab (lab 7), this is the system we are going to use:\r\n1. Create a new user account on cloud9.\r\n2. Create a new public HTML5 workspace named comp4513-lab7\r\n3. You can code directly within the cloud9 ide if you haven't completed the lab. If you have already completed the lab, then simply upload all the files (under the File | Upload Local Files menu command).\r\n4. test to make sure it works (use the preview button)\r\n5. When it is ready to be marked, share it with me. Use the Share button in the upper right corner of your workspace. In the share dialog, invite me to have access to your workspace via my email (rconnolly@mtroyal.ca). Keep it as RW so I can add a note telling you if something needs to be fixed etc.\r\n6. If it works, I should be able to test it. It would be great if someone can try this in the next 24 hours so I can verify that this approach works! :-)\r\nRandy\r\n\r\n",

Once you get it to work you can try three values or to use text like 'good', 'bad'. Whatever you do you need to have your classification domain match the domain of the cost matrix 'actual value' and 'predicted value'. \r\n\r\n",
