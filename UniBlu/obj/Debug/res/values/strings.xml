    Sonia, the group alpha, has a flair for style as can be seen from the look of the app.  She is a great team leader, 
who only gets mad when James is super annoying.  She brings depth of experience when dealing with integration of services
into both web and app development.  She comes from a good family, inheriting her good looks from her mother and her Joie de
vivre from her dad. We were lucky to have her as our leader cuz she played the "girl" card with Jordan and got us extra 
marks (Jordan dig!).
  </string><string name="aboutJames">
	James, clearly the most mature of the group, the best dresser and the one his fellow students voted most likely
not to graduate!  After a few false starts, the group came to rely on his ability to copy and paste.  His drive to create 
checklists was only exceeded by his ability to mark them done -- without him, our Trello board would have been lacking in 
such important unimplemented features such as print screen, only show unread messages, and having a filter to ensure that
the lunch hour was free to eat.  He was the pomp and circumstance when the team was wondering "P.S.K. What Does It Mean?"
  </string><string name="aboutRyan">
	Ryan, soft spoken, even keeled,even in the face of epic design battles between James and Sonia.  Attentive, 
thoughtful, he listens and weighs the arguments and then, after allowing the debate to simmer, says "How about .... ?", 
which was of course the right idea and got the group off dead center.  Ryan can be counted on to do his part in a reliable
and professional manner.  He single handedly guided the group through the Azure setup and database implementation.
